# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Bring it all together.

Congratulations on making it to almost the end. Before you start the Capstone I created a warm up that will bring everything together that we have learned and be a blueprint to help you with your Capstone project. You are going to build an end to end project where a user can register, login, edit, see, and delete users. Do not spend your time watching videos on lectures, use the github examples from me or what you have submitted.

For this assignment, you are to work on teams and not by yourself. If you are in a room working by yourself, I will use my zoom admin powers and move you to your team room. When working as a team, there should be one driver that is sharing their code. When a feature is complete, the code would be tested, pushed to Github, and then pulled down for another member of the team to be the driver on the next feature. This should be done so everyone on the team is a driver for multiple features. I will be visiting rooms and I want to see code up the screen and you collaborating as a team.

This assignment will be broken down into two different repositories on Github. One for the backend and one for the frontend.

Backend:
The backend is broken down into the following features. Each feature is a new branch. When you start a feature, create a new branch, test the code using Postman, and finally merge your code. Then the next driver will pull down the code from Github, create a new branch, and start the next feature.

Here are the features:
Create a new repository on Github and add all the team members.
Build the skeleton of the backend using npm and add the dependencies.
Build a user table using Prisma. This table should contain a UUID that is the primary key, a first name, last name, email that is unique, and a password. All fields should be not null.
Create the register endpoint. A user will enter an email, first name, last name, and password. The password will be encrypted using bcrypt and the end point will return the users information and a JSON web token that is good for one hour. Create a folder for routes, controllers, and queries. Here is an example. Test this in Postman
Create a login endpoint. The user will enter their email and password, use bcrypt compare for the password and return the users information and a JSON web token. Test this in Postman.
Create an endpoint to get all the users. This is a protected route, use middleware to make sure the user has a valid JSON web token. If they do return all the users, if not return an unauthorized error. Test this in Postman (Are you seeing a pattern?).
Create a delete endpoint for a user. This is another protected route, the same as above.
Create an update endpoint for a user. This should take in the email, first name, last name, and password, then update the user's information. Don’t forget to use bcrypt for the password. This is also a protected route
Once you are done and all routes have been tested, deploy on render. Here is the link. Reach out if you have any questions.
Once deployed, test all routes using Postman.

Frontend:

For the frontend you are going to create another Github repository and test it against the code you deployed for the backend. The frontend is broken down into the following features. Each feature is a new branch. When you start a feature, create a new branch, test your code, and finally merge your code. Then the next driver will pull down the code from Github, create a new branch, and start the next feature.

Here are the features:
✅ Create a new repository on Github and add all the team members.
✅ Create a new Vite react project and create components folder, in the folder add three .jsx files, Registration, Login, and Home.
✅ For registration .jsx file where the user enters in a form their email, first name, last name, and password. Use redux tool kit to send the data to the backend and use windows.sessionstorage to save the token. Once the user is done, >>>redirect to the home page.

For login .jsx file where the user enters their email and password into a form. Save the token used redux tool kit and redirect to the home page.
Create a protected route for the home page. If there is no JSON web token, redirect to the login page. The home page should display a list of all the users. Each user should have two buttons by it, one for delete and one for update.
The delete button should delete the user. You should not be able to delete the user that is signed in. Use tags so the file will update when you delete the user.
Create an update page so when the user clicks on the update button, they go to a page that displays all that user’s information in a form. Then they can update that user's information. Once done, redirect to the home page.
Deploy the front end.

Bonus:

Work on error handling on the frontend and backend
Add React Router
In the back end a user cannot delete themselves.

Once you are done, show me the deployed web site. Then start planning your Capstone.
